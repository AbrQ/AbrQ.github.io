            <p>All of us have enjoyed at some point a good movie, video game and maybe even a conversation related to the great changes that technology has brought to human life.</p>

            <p>Technology is an issue that is always interesting and controversial at the same time due to two main factors:</p>

            <ul>
              <li> The little knowledge that people have regarding this topic
              <li> The morbidity generated by apocalyptic themes related to artificial intelligence
              
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">In the previous century</h2>

            <p>On the other hand, this technology has been called "mobile computing" due to the more primitive computer concept: "A machine capable of performing many operations at a high speed". The above, has to do in a big way because the mobile phone has: 
            .
            <ul>
              <li> OS
              <li> Sensors
              <li> Processor
              <li> Memory
              <li> Camera
              <li> Antenna
            </ul></p>

            <p>Among other artifacts which make the phone a powerful computer.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Ubiquitous computing</h2>

            <p>Such has been the user impact using the mobile technology that has emerged among the scientific community the term: <i>"Ubiquitous computing"</i> which aims to explain how computing is a concept that today is always present in the life of man, not differentiating it from other objects with which we live every day.</p>

            <p>Such has been the user impact using the mobile technology that has emerged among the scientific community the term: <i>"Ubiquitous computing"</i> which aims to explain how computing is a concept that today is always present in the life of man, not differentiating it from other objects with which we live every day.</p>

            <p>Forty or thirty years ago, a computer was an object which we differentiated from the rest and whose use was for a specific purpose. However, today computing has become part of our daily life with endless uses and applications, including the <i>"smartwatch"</i> and other technologies which complement our outfit and give us access to technology as we never would have imagined.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Mobile computing; access to our world.</span>

            <p>Finally, mobile computing is a very powerful tool which will surely be present and evolve in different gadgets which will not only seek to make life easier with endless applications, but will also be part of our personality and an indispensable artifact..</p>
